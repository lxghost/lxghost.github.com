New to OINK? [Start with the Starter](/docs/start/) to preview a working site,
then replace its sample content. Write in Markdown and build with Hugo Extended;
Hugo Modules also require Go to resolve the theme. Bundled theme assets need no
CDN or npm build step.

The current release is {{% param version %}}. See the
[1.2 release notes](/blog/release/1.2.0/) or the
[upgrade guide](/docs/admin/upgrade/#preparing-1-2) for an existing site.

## Five ways in {#five-entries}

- [Get started](/docs/start/) — create an OINK Starter repository, establish a local baseline, customize it in layers, deploy.
- [Components](/docs/components/) — one page per component, source first and rendered result after it.
- [Write Beautiful Docs](/book/) — a tutorial in progress; the first three chapters cover preview, structure and page composition.
- [Case studies](/case/) — production sites explained as reusable design and migration patterns.
- [Design and development](/docs/design/) — contracts, accepted decisions, research evidence, and active proposals for OINK maintainers.

or maintain the contracts and design records behind it.
