OINK is a Hugo theme for technical documentation. Components are part of the
Markdown syntax rather than a second template language; the fonts, icons,
search and diagram runtimes the browser needs ship with the theme; the only
build dependency is one Hugo Extended binary, with no Node.js and no CDN
request. The current release is {{% param version %}}.

## Five ways in {#five-entries}

- [Quick start](/docs/start/) — install Hugo, clone this site, replace the site details, deploy.
- [Components](/docs/components/) — one page per component, source first and rendered result after it.
- [Write Beautiful Docs](/book/) — a hands-on tutorial from first preview to a maintained publication.
- [Case studies](/case/) — production sites explained as reusable design and migration patterns.
- [Design and development](/docs/design/) — contracts, accepted decisions, research evidence, and active proposals for OINK maintainers.

or maintain the contracts and design records behind it.
