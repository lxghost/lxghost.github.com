This page covers a page's skeleton: whether it has a sidebar, how wide that is,
how deep the outline goes, and whether a section index is a list or cards. Where
content goes is in [Organizing content](/docs/write/organize/); this page is
only about the shell.

The rule is that **the shell follows `type`, not the path**. Documentation can
live anywhere under `content/` as long as it has `type: docs`.

## Shell types {#shell-types}

`params.ui.shell_types` lists the types that use the reading shell with a
sidebar:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    shell_types: [docs, book, blog, swagger]
```

| type | Shell |
| --- | --- |
| `docs` | The documentation shell: left sidebar (section switcher + tree) + body + right-hand outline |
| `book` | The documentation shell, plus numbered targets, the `reading_width` measure and the draft banner |
| `blog` | The documentation shell, with the sidebar expanded by default and RSS as the left half of the title row |
| `swagger` | The documentation shell, with the body handed to Swagger UI or Redoc — see [API reference pages](/docs/write/openapi/) |
| Any other type | An ordinary page: navbar + single-column body + footer, with no sidebar |

Taxonomy and term pages are not in this table but use the same shell.

Assigning a type to a subtree uses a cascade, which is how documentation ends up
at an arbitrary path:

```yaml {title="content/handbook/_index.md"}
---
title: Operations handbook
type: docs
cascade:
  type: docs
---
```

### Section roots are only navigation starting points {#sections}

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    docs_section: docs
    blog_section: blog
```

These two keys **do not decide the shell**. They tell the theme where the
documentation and blog trees are rooted, for resolving the sidebar root, quick
links and default icons. The `content/handbook/` example above still has the
documentation shell, and leaving `docs_section` at `docs` does not affect it.

To make a docs page's sidebar root the site home rather than the documentation
section:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    docs_sidebar_root: home # home | section
```

Those are the only two values, and anything else fails the build.

### Documentation at the site root {#docs-at-root}

A documentation-first site can publish the `docs` section at the URL root while
the source stays in `content/docs/`. Three pieces of configuration are needed
together.

The first uses Hugo's own `permalinks` to drop the `docs/` segment from URLs:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
permalinks:
  page:
    docs: /:sections[1:]/:slug/
  section:
    docs: /:sections[1:]
```

The second keeps the physical site root index usable as a link target while no
longer competing for the same output path. Every language's site root index
(`content/_index.md`, `content/_index.zh.md`) needs it:

```yaml {title="content/_index.md"}
---
title: Product Docs
build: { render: link }
---
```

The third declares the sidebar root to be the site home, so the sidebar and the
pager share one tree:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    sidebar_root_enabled: true
    docs_sidebar_root: home
```

With `docs_sidebar_root: home`, every top-level section of the site home enters
that tree. Overview sections that are not part of the reading sequence — blog,
community, download — opt out with `toc_root: true` in their own `_index.md`,
which keeps them out of the tree and out of the paging order:

```yaml {title="content/blog/_index.md"}
---
title: Blog
toc_root: true
---
```

Documentation then shares the URL root with blog, community and the rest. Build
with `--printPathWarnings` and resolve every duplicate target before publishing.

### Landing pages {#landing}

Any page with `layout: landing` uses the landing layout: navbar + a body
assembled from sections + footer, with no sidebar. How to write the data is in
[Home and landing pages](/docs/customize/home/).

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    landing_search: true
```

`landing_search: false` removes the search entry point from the landing shell
and affects no other page.

## Sidebar {#sidebar}

The sidebar tree comes from the shape of `content/`, ordered by `weight` and
labelled with `linkTitle` where one exists. What is adjustable is density and
size:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    sidebar_menu_compact: true
    sidebar_menu_foldable: true
    sidebar_menu_truncate: 2000
    sidebar_width_min: 220
    sidebar_width_max: 480
    sidebar_item_overflow: ellipsis # ellipsis | wrap
    sidebar_expand_levels: 2
```

- `sidebar_menu_compact` expands only the current branch and its neighbours; `false` expands the whole tree.
- `sidebar_menu_foldable` lets the reader expand and collapse sections manually. Blog sections are expanded by default; to collapse one by default, write `sidebar_expanded: false` in its `_index.md`.
- `sidebar_expand_levels` is how many levels are expanded by default.
- `sidebar_menu_truncate` is the maximum entries rendered per section, so a thousand-page tree does not inflate the HTML past usability.
- `sidebar_width_min` / `sidebar_width_max` bound drag-resizing on the desktop, in pixels. The reader's adjusted width is kept locally, and double-clicking the divider restores the default.
- `sidebar_item_overflow` defaults to `ellipsis` (long titles truncate); a site with many long titles can use `wrap`.

Fold state, width and scroll position are stored locally per language. Below
`md` the sidebar becomes a drawer with a backdrop.

To drop the sidebar on one page, use front matter:

```yaml {title="content/docs/fullscreen-report.md"}
---
title: Full-screen report
sidebar_enabled: false
---
```

### An explicit navigation tree, data/docs_nav.json {#docs-nav}

The sidebar tree is derived from `content/` by default. A site may also supply
an explicit navigation manifest, and the theme renders from it when three
conditions hold together:

- The site has a `data/docs_nav.json` containing a `sections` key;
- The page's type is `docs` or `book`;
- The resolved sidebar root is not the site home.

The file is a nested node tree. Each node's `page` points at a content path,
`url` is its link, and `children` are its children; `active_path_by_url` records
the ancestor chain for each URL, used for highlighting the current entry:

```json {title="data/docs_nav.json"}
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "page": "/docs/start",
      "url": "/docs/start/",
      "children": [{ "page": "/docs/start/install", "url": "/docs/start/install/" }]
    }
  ],
  "active_path_by_url": {
    "/docs/start/install/": ["/docs/start/"]
  }
}
```

URLs have their language prefix stripped before comparison, so one file serves
every language.

That tree also decides the paging order, so the sidebar and previous / next
never disagree. An empty `sections` array fails the build
(`data/docs_nav.json does not define any Docs navigation sections`), and a
`page` pointing at a page that does not exist fails too
(`Docs navigation page not found`). Placeholder nodes with `manual_link` and
`sidebar_divider` rows stay in the sidebar without becoming paging targets.

It suits a site whose navigation order is generated by an external tool — a
manual migrated from a Sphinx toctree that has to freeze its existing chapter
order, say. Where order is maintained by `weight` in `content/`, the file is not
needed.

### Sidebar icon density {#sidebar-icons}

An `icon` in a page's front matter appears in the sidebar. Icons on every leaf
page reduce readability, so a density policy controls them:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    sidebar_icon_policy: groups # all | groups | none
```

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | Every entry with an icon shows it (the compatibility default when unset) |
| `groups` | Only the root and nodes with children show icons |
| `none` | No entry icons in the sidebar |

An invalid value only warns and falls back to `all` rather than failing the
build. This site uses `groups`.

### Expanding headings in the sidebar {#sidebar-headings}

Book pages can expand an h2–h4 branch under the current sidebar row, which helps
navigation inside a long chapter:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    sidebar_headings: 3 # false | true | 2 | 3 | 4
```

An integer sets the deepest level expanded (2–4), `true` means 2 (h2 only), and
`false` turns it off. Out of range fails the build. It applies to `type: book`
pages only, and expands only under the current sidebar row.

## Table of contents {#toc}

The right-hand outline is generated by Hugo from the Markdown headings, and the
levels collected are Hugo's own configuration:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
markup:
  tableOfContents:
    startLevel: 2
    endLevel: 4
    ordered: false
```

The theme governs only the tracking behaviour:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    scroll_spy: false
```

Scroll tracking is **off** by default. Set to `true`, the outline draws a
continuous rail, highlights the current section and marks the position. The
reader can collapse the right column entirely, and that state is kept locally.
Below `xl` the right column is hidden and its content moves into the sidebar
drawer.

To hide the outline on one page, use the front matter `notoc: true`.

Only headings that reach Hugo's table of contents appear in the outline:
headings emitted by a Markdown-form shortcode (`{{%/* … */%}}`) do, and those
from an ordinary shortcode (`{{</* … */>}}`) usually do not. Structural headings
belong in the Markdown.

## Section index style {#section-index}

A section with an `_index.md` lists its child pages automatically, in one of two
styles:

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  ui:
    section_index: cards # list | cards
    section_index_columns: 2
```

- `list` (the default): one title plus description paragraph per child page;
- `cards`: a grid of cards reading each child's `title` (or `linkTitle`), `description` and `icon`.

It can be overridden per section, and an invalid value fails the build:

```yaml {title="content/docs/components/_index.md"}
---
title: Components
section_index: cards
section_index_columns: 3
---
```

Related page-level switches: `no_list: true` lists no children;
`simple_list: true` emits a bulleted list with no descriptions; and a child page
with `hide_summary: true` removes itself from the list. **Do not hand-write a
child list**: a hand-written one goes out of step with the sidebar.

## Page width {#page-width}

```yaml {title="hugo.yml"}
params:
  page_width: normal # normal | wide | full
```

`normal` is the usual reading width, `wide` widens the content column, and
`full` fills the viewport. It can be overridden per page or per section; wide
tables, large images and API reference pages often use `wide`:

```yaml {title="content/docs/api/reference.md"}
---
title: API reference
page_width: wide
---
```

Book pages additionally have `reading_width` (`slim` / `normal` / `wide`), which
changes the body's own reading measure without touching the shell. An invalid
value in either key fails the build.

## Navbar and footer switches {#chrome}

The navbar and footer are per-page layout decisions, written at the **top
level** of front matter (not under `ui`), and can be set once with a section
cascade:

```yaml {title="content/docs/_index.md"}
---
title: Docs
cascade:
  navbar_enabled: false
  footer_style: slim
---
```

The behaviour is in
[Navigation and menus](/docs/customize/navigation/#navbar-disable) and
[Brand and appearance](/docs/customize/brand/#footer), and the key definitions
in [Page parameters](/docs/write/frontmatter/).

## Verify {#verify}

```bash
hugo --printPathWarnings --panicOnWarning
```

- The build prints `Total in …` with no ERROR and no WARN;
- A newly created `type: docs` page has a left sidebar. If not, check whether the cascade reaches that page and whether `shell_types` contains the type;
- Drag the sidebar divider, reload and confirm the width persists; double-click restores the default;
- Below `md` the sidebar becomes a closable drawer, and below `xl` the outline moves into the drawer;
- A section index has as many cards as the sidebar has child pages;
- A page with `page_width: wide` is wider than its neighbours;
- With documentation at the site root, `hugo --printPathWarnings` reports no duplicate output paths.
