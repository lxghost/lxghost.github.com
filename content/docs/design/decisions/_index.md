OINK used to keep reviews, PRDs, and execution notes in a local `plan/`
directory. That made useful reasoning hard to discover and allowed abandoned
designs to look authoritative. Accepted reasoning now lives here, in the same
bilingual, versioned site as the contracts it supports.

## Decision map {#decision-map}

| Decision                                                           | What it settles                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Warnings and safe fallbacks](/docs/design/decisions/diagnostics/) | Why ordinary preview survives invalid input while publication remains strict                             |
| [Configuration model](/docs/design/decisions/configuration/)       | Where configuration belongs, how pages override it, and why OINK has no parallel configuration namespace |
| [Markdown-first authoring](/docs/design/decisions/authoring/)      | Why native Markdown is preferred and Docs, Blog, Book, and Landing extend shared systems                 |
| [Generated configuration schema](/docs/design/decisions/config-schema/) | Why the editor schemas are a generated projection, and how the drift gate keeps a third configuration authority from appearing |

## Record format {#record-format}

An accepted decision records context, the choice, consequences, and the proof
that makes the choice current. It does not reproduce a parameter reference or
a tutorial. Every decision links to its owning contract and verification
surface, and its English and Simplified Chinese pages change together.

When a decision changes, update the implementation, checker, affected
contract, and decision record in one delivery. Preserve the old answer in Git
history and the release changelog instead of leaving two active answers in the
navigation tree.
