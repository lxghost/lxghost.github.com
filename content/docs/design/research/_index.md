Research belongs in the public Design tree when another maintainer can inspect
its method, understand its limits, and repeat the relevant check. Raw agent
transcripts, temporary build logs, and local absolute paths do not meet that
standard.

## Publication rules {#publication-rules}

A research record states its date, inputs, relevant versions, method, result,
and known limits. Volatile counts are labeled as snapshots. External framework
comparisons are refreshed from primary sources before publication and distilled
into OINK-relevant conclusions rather than copied as a competitor catalogue.

When a result becomes a stable product choice, link it from an accepted
[decision](/docs/design/decisions/). When it proposes behaviour that does not
exist, move the design question to [Proposals](/docs/design/proposals/).
