An API reference page is one OpenAPI specification plus one shortcode. The
Swagger UI and Redoc runtimes ship with the theme (versions 5.32.13 and 2.5.3
respectively, per the repository's `VENDOR.json`), load only on a page that uses
them in its HTML output, and reach no external service at build time or in the
browser. Swagger UI's online validator is pinned off (`validatorUrl: null`), so
a published API page never sends its specification address anywhere.

Three steps: put the specification file under `static/`, create a page with the
shortcode, and change the page `type` to `swagger` if it needs the dedicated
shell.

## Where the specification file goes {#spec-file}
The specification goes under `static/`, is published unchanged at the site root,
and both shortcodes then receive a URL the browser can fetch:

```filetree {title="where the specification lives"}
- static/
  - openapi/
    - docs-demo.yaml    # published as /openapi/docs-demo.yaml
- content/
  - docs/
    - write/
      - openapi.md       # this page
```

Do not put the specification beside the page. `redoc` looks for a file of that
name in the content directory and builds a URL from it, but a `.yaml` in the
content directory is a page resource, and Hugo publishes one only when it is
referenced or processed. `redoc` builds a URL without referencing the resource,
so the browser gets a 404.

A remote specification (starting `https://…`) is accepted by both shortcodes,
but that is a network dependency, and it exposes the reader's metadata to that
host. Intranet deployments and sites with a CSP should use a same-origin
specification. Only `http` and `https` are accepted: any other scheme, a
protocol-relative `//host`, or an empty value warns and the shortcode renders
nothing.

The examples below use the real `/openapi/docs-demo.yaml`, a demonstration
cluster-management API with no reachable server behind it.

## Swagger UI {#swaggerui}

`swagger` has one named parameter, `src`, whose value is a URL from the site
root. It passes through the theme's URL validation, so a subpath deployment
resolves correctly:

```markdown {title="Source"}
{{</* swagger src="/openapi/docs-demo.yaml" */>}}
```

It renders a container with `class="td-swagger-ui"` carrying the specification
address in `data-td-spec-url`; a single cacheable `js/chunks/swagger-init.js`
mounts every container on the page. The container ID is derived from the page
address and the shortcode's ordinal (`td-swagger-<hash>-<n>`), so one page can
hold several.

This page shows the source without rendering Swagger UI: the markup it generates
carries axe WCAG AA violations (the server dropdown has no accessible name, and
the version stamp is a scrollable region without keyboard access), and this
site's accessibility gate requires zero violations per page. The Redoc below is
really rendered — but be aware that both widgets are scoped out of that gate,
because Redoc's operation descriptions have their own colour-contrast defect.
Neither is a fully accessible interface; see [Limits](#limits).

## Redoc {#redoc}

`redoc` takes exactly one positional parameter, the specification path. A
second parameter warns and the shortcode renders nothing.

```markdown {title="Source"}
{{</* redoc "openapi/docs-demo.yaml" */>}}
```

{{< redoc "openapi/docs-demo.yaml" >}}

Path resolution has three branches, in order: anything starting with `http` is
a remote URL; a file of that name found in the content directory yields
`baseURL + page directory + filename`; otherwise it is `baseURL + the path as
written`. So a `redoc` path must not begin with a slash — `/openapi/…` would
produce a doubled slash such as `https://example.com//openapi/…`. Unlike
`swagger`, it generates an absolute URL based on `baseURL`.

The theme pins five attributes — `hide-hostname`, `hide-logo`,
`suppress-warnings`, `lazy-rendering`, `native-scrollbars` — and hides the
Redocly brand mark with CSS. Redoc's remaining attributes are not exposed to
authors; a site that needs them overrides
`layouts/_shortcodes/redoc.html`.

## The dedicated page shell {#shell}

API reference pages tend to be wide and long, which is what the `swagger` page
type is for:

```yaml {title="content/api/_index.md"}
---
title: Cluster management API
type: swagger
page_width: wide
cascade:
  type: swagger
---
```

`swagger` is one of the theme's default shell types (`params.ui.shell_types`
defaults to `[docs, book, blog, swagger]`, and a site that overrides the list
needs to keep it). It differs from the `docs` shell in exactly two ways: an
extra `td-swagger` class on `<body>` for styling hooks, and no version banner.
Sidebar, table of contents, breadcrumbs, pager and page end all behave normally.

Shells and page width are covered fully in
[Layouts and page types](/docs/customize/layout/).

## Output {#outputs}

| Output | What appears |
| --- | --- |
| HTML | The full interactive Swagger UI / Redoc; the runtime loads on demand from local files, with no CDN, and only in this output |
| Print | A labelled static link showing the specification's address; neither runtime loads |
| Markdown | A plain Markdown link, `[OpenAPI specification](/openapi/example.yaml)`; it does not degrade into an endpoint list |
| RSS | The same plain link |

Outside HTML an API reference is a pointer, not a reference. To put endpoint
information into print or agent output as well, describe the key endpoints in
prose on the same page; body text outside the shortcode survives intact in all
four outputs.

## Limits {#limits}

- Both components derive their container ID from the page address and the shortcode's ordinal, so several on one page never collide.
- The two can coexist on one page, but the page becomes long and its HTML output loads both runtimes. Pick one for a production site.
- Neither interface is fully accessible, and both come from upstream distributions the theme does not rewrite. Swagger UI's markup has axe WCAG AA violations (`select-name`, `scrollable-region-focusable`); Redoc's operation descriptions fail AA colour contrast. This site excludes `.td-swagger-ui` and `.td-redoc` from its zero-violation gate for that reason — a site with such a gate has to do the same, and should say so rather than assume either widget passes.
- `redoc` accepts no attribute parameter: a second positional argument warns and the shortcode renders nothing.
- A `redoc` path must not start with `/`, or the URL gains a doubled slash.
- The specification must be fetchable by the browser: put it in `static/` and confirm the file exists under `public/` after a build.
- There is no mock server: Swagger UI's "Try it out" makes a real request to whatever `servers` names, and the address in the sample specification is not reachable.

## Verify {#verify}

1. The build is warning-free: `hugo --printPathWarnings --panicOnWarning`.
2. The specification really was published: `ls public/openapi/docs-demo.yaml`, or open `http://localhost:1313/openapi/docs-demo.yaml`.
3. Endpoints expand on the page and their schemas appear; the browser console shows no 404 and no cross-origin error.
4. Reload once with the network off: the runtimes are local, and with a same-origin specification the interface should still appear.
