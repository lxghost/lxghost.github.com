# API reference pages

> Put an OpenAPI specification on the site and render it as a browsable API reference with the bundled Swagger UI or Redoc, without touching a CDN.

An API reference page is one OpenAPI specification plus one shortcode. Choose
Swagger UI when readers need to try requests, or Redoc for browsing endpoint
descriptions and schemas. Both runtimes ship with the theme and load only on
pages that use them in HTML output, without a CDN. Swagger UI's online validator
is disabled; remote specifications and API requests still contact their
configured hosts.

Three steps: put the specification file under `static/`, create a page with the
shortcode, and change the page `type` to `swagger` if it needs the dedicated
shell.

## Where the specification file goes {#spec-file}
The specification goes under `static/`, is published unchanged at the site root,
and both shortcodes then receive a URL the browser can fetch:

```filetree {title="where the specification lives"}
- static/
  - openapi/
    - docs-demo.yaml    # published as /openapi/docs-demo.yaml
- content/
  - docs/
    - write/
      - openapi.md       # this page
```

Do not put the specification beside the page. Both shortcodes treat a local
value as a path under `static/`; neither resolves page resources. A `.yaml`
beside a content page is a page resource, and Hugo does not publish it merely
because its name appears in one of these shortcodes, so the browser gets a 404.

A remote specification (starting `https://…`) is accepted by both shortcodes,
but that is a network dependency, and it exposes the reader's metadata to that
host. Intranet deployments and sites with a CSP should use a same-origin
specification. Only `http` and `https` are accepted: any other scheme, a
protocol-relative `//host`, or an empty value warns and the shortcode renders
nothing.

To try the examples, download [docs-demo.yaml](/openapi/docs-demo.yaml) and save
it as `static/openapi/docs-demo.yaml` in your site. It describes a demonstration
cluster-management API with no reachable server behind it.

## Swagger UI {#swaggerui}

`swagger` has one named parameter, `src`, whose value is a URL from the site
root. It passes through the theme's URL validation, so a subpath deployment
resolves correctly:

```markdown {title="Source"}
{{< swagger src="/openapi/docs-demo.yaml" >}}
```

In your local preview, this displays expandable API operations, request
parameters and response schemas. "Try it out" sends requests to the
specification's `servers` address; the sample has no working backend.

This page shows Swagger UI source and a live Redoc example below. Both widgets
have known accessibility limitations; see [Limits](#limits).

## Redoc {#redoc}

`redoc` takes exactly one positional parameter, the specification path. A
second parameter warns and the shortcode renders nothing.

```markdown {title="Source"}
{{< redoc "openapi/docs-demo.yaml" >}}
```

[OpenAPI specification](http://localhost:1313/openapi/docs-demo.yaml)

An `http` or `https` URL remains remote. Any other accepted value is a path
under `static/`; leading and non-leading slash forms are equivalent. For
example, `openapi/docs-demo.yaml` and `/openapi/docs-demo.yaml` both become
`https://example.com/preview/openapi/docs-demo.yaml` when the site `baseURL` is
`https://example.com/preview/`. Unlike `swagger`, Redoc receives this absolute
URL based on `baseURL`.

The theme pins five attributes — `hide-hostname`, `hide-logo`,
`suppress-warnings`, `lazy-rendering`, `native-scrollbars` — and hides the
Redocly brand mark with CSS. Redoc's remaining attributes are not exposed to
authors; a site that needs them overrides
`layouts/_shortcodes/redoc.html`.

## The dedicated page shell {#shell}

API reference pages tend to be wide and long, which is what the `swagger` page
type is for:

```yaml {title="content/api/_index.md"}
---
title: Cluster management API
type: swagger
page_width: wide
cascade:
  type: swagger
---
```

`swagger` is one of the theme's default shell types (`params.ui.shell_types`
defaults to `[docs, book, blog, swagger]`, and a site that overrides the list
needs to keep it). It differs from the `docs` shell in exactly two ways: an
extra `td-swagger` class on `<body>` for styling hooks, and no version banner.
Sidebar, table of contents, breadcrumbs, pager and page end all behave normally.

Shells and page width are covered fully in
[Layouts and page types](/docs/customize/layout/).

## Output {#outputs}

| Output | What appears |
| --- | --- |
| HTML | The full interactive Swagger UI / Redoc; the runtime loads on demand from local files, with no CDN, and only in this output |
| Print | A labelled static link showing the specification's address; neither runtime loads |
| Markdown | A plain Markdown link, `[OpenAPI specification](/openapi/example.yaml)`; it does not degrade into an endpoint list |
| RSS | The same plain link |

Outside HTML an API reference is a pointer, not a reference. To put endpoint
information into print or agent output as well, describe the key endpoints in
prose on the same page; body text outside the shortcode survives intact in all
four outputs.

## Limits {#limits}

- Both components derive their container ID from the page address and the shortcode's ordinal, so several on one page never collide.
- The two can coexist on one page, but the page becomes long and its HTML output loads both runtimes. Pick one for a production site.
- Neither interface is fully accessible: Swagger UI has unnamed server controls and scrollable regions without keyboard access; Redoc's operation descriptions have insufficient colour contrast. Assess these limitations against your site's accessibility requirements. Excluding a widget from an automated check does not make it conformant; provide readable endpoint documentation when an embedded widget is unsuitable.
- `redoc` accepts no attribute parameter: a second positional argument warns and the shortcode renders nothing.
- A local `redoc` path is rooted under `static/`; a leading `/` is optional, and page resources are not resolved.
- The specification must be fetchable by the browser: put it in `static/` and confirm the file exists under `public/` after a build.
- There is no mock server: Swagger UI's "Try it out" makes a real request to whatever `servers` names, and the address in the sample specification is not reachable.

## Verify {#verify}

1. The build is warning-free: `hugo --printPathWarnings --panicOnWarning`.
2. The specification really was published: `ls public/openapi/docs-demo.yaml`, or open `http://localhost:1313/openapi/docs-demo.yaml`.
3. Endpoints expand on the page and their schemas appear; the browser console shows no 404 and no cross-origin error.
4. Disconnect from the external network while keeping the local preview server reachable, then reload: local runtimes and a same-origin specification should still appear.
